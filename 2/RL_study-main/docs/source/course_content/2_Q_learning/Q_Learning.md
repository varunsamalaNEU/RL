# Q-learning

This page contains the readings and homework assignments for the Unit: Q-learning

We will be following the content of the Deep RL course on huggingface.co

Upon completing this unit, you should be able to understand the basis behind Q-learning. You should also be familiar with concepts relating to Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning. Finally, you will also be able to write your own policy to learn how to play a simple game.
