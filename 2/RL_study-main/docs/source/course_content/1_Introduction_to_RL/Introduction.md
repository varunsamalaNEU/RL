# Introduction to RL and Deep RL

This page contains the readings and homework assignments for the Unit: Introduction to RL

We will be following the content of the Deep RL course on huggingface.co

After completing this unit, you would have gained an understanding of what is reinforcement learning (RL) in general, and be aware of the characteristics of RL

1. Guided readings
    * Read the sections in [huggingface.co - Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit1/introduction?fw=pt)
        * Introduction
        * What is Reinforcement Learning?
        * The Reinforcement Learning Framework
        * The type of tasks
        * The Exploration/Exploitation tradeoff
        * The two main approaches for solving RL problems
        * The "Deep" in Deep Reinforcement Learning
        * Summary
        * Glossary
        * Quiz
  
2. Reading assignment:
    * Read Chapter 1, 2 and 3 of the book (http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
    * Watch the video lecture on the [mechanisms behind RL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GwBez0D20A)
  
3. Exercises:
    * Get a feel of using the current state of the art libraries to train an agent in the [Hands-On section](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit1/hands-on)
        * You can also run your code locally with the Jupyter notebook, which is provided in this Unit folder
        * Note that lines of code that begining with `!sudo ...` are ommitted in the Jupyter notebook as they only apply when you are using Google Colab.
    * (Optional) - Feel free to play around with the Huggy dog in Bonus Unit 1 after you have finished your readings
